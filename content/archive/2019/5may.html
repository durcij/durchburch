  <h3 class = "text">IRBeast Development Experience</h3>
  <p class = "window-wrapper"><img src="../../blogimages/irbeast.png"></p>
  <p class = "text">Overall, I found the IRBeast project to be a powerful learning experience.  There have been a lot of struggles for myself in my time on this team.  I learned how I work best, and I spent time out of my comfort zone, both of which are vital to learning how to succeed in one's life and in the industry.</p>
  <p class = "text">I struggled a lot on this project, as I was relatively inexperienced with the Codecov implementation that I was trying to work out.  Sometimes it felt like I wasn't going anywhere.  That said, I did receive some help from other students more experienced with Codecov, and I'm pretty sure that everything they helped me with worked out in the end.</p>
  <p class = "text">As I said, I learned a lot about how I work best.  I found that I need a clear role on a team to be most able to work well.  I need some level of guidance, supervision, and a defined plan to succeed in my coding.  Luckily, many jobs in the industry have these clear roles and strong visions that lead to well-defined plans.  The time I spent out of my comfort zone also told me where my comfort zone is when it comes to coding.  I've found that I'm most comfortable in a position where I know what I'm doing and where I'm going next.</p>
  <p class = "text">I'm glad I was able to learn all of this about myself, as it has helped me to prepare for a future in the industry.  That said, I can't help but feel like I was underutilized on this project.</p>
