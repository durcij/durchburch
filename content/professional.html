<p class = "text">I'm Jordan Durci:  a computer science major at Allegheny college.  I'm minoring in psychology and philosophy.  My expected graduation date is May 2020.  I'm the president of the campus's Comics Club, though I've previously been the treasurer and later vice president of the Legion of Allegheny Gamers, our gaming club, as well as the vice president of Comics Club.  I have worked in Java, Python, NetLogo, C#, HTML, CSS, C, C++, and much more.  I'm most proficient in Java, HTML, CSS, and C#.</p>

<p class = "text">In my schooling, I've worked on multiple programs built in Unity, including one called <a href="https://github.com/Allegheny-College-Science-310-F2018/project-cmpsc-310-fall-2018-allegheny-college-garfield-5-operation-dessert-lasagna">the Watchers</a>, which was a final project for a class on AI.  It's incomplete as a game, but displys some of my own coding (primarily for character functions like moving), and my proficiency in spritework as of fall 2018.  I've also worked on my senior comprehensive project, which also utilized Unity to create a four-player, top-down game called <a href="https://github.com/durcij/game-for-comp">Emotion Commotion</a>.  The game shows how far along my game development, character design, spriting skills, and more have developed over time.</p>

<p class = "text">I've recently begun doing freelance pixel art at a rather reasonable price, though it could probably be argued that I'm undercharging.  That said, examples of my recent spritework can be seen both on my DeviantArt, linked on my <a href="creative.html">Creative</a> page, as well as on my LinkedIn (linked below), under my Freelance Pixel Artist occupation listing.</p>

<p class = "text">For more resume-style information, please refer to my LinkedIn, I make an effort to keep it up-to-date.  If you're looking for a true resume, I apologize, but I don't keep one here.  My LinkedIn has become my main focus as general professional information goes, so I only write and update my resumes as needed.</p>
