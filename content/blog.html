<p class = "text">2018 was a tough year:  for myself, for the woman I love, for the friends around me, and for many more.  The struggles we went through, many of us certainly hope to never go through again.  Deaths and near deaths of loved ones, anger directed at those we love, and traumatic experiences are just a few of the things we all went through.  In 2018, some of us were hurt by others, and some of us have hurt others.</p>
<p class = "text">However, as bad as 2018 was, there were some gems.  Loves were rekindled, new loves were found, friendships were forged and strengthened, and futures were shaped for the better.  Despite all the bad, we all found something to hold on to and cherish in 2018.</p>
<p class = "text">Now we look on to 2019.  A year with promise to be better, but only our work will bring that promise to fruition.  Here's to a new year, and new work to make it great!  Here's to the loves, new and old, that will burn throughout 2019!  Here's to the friendships that will be forged and tempered in the coming year!  Here's to the challenges we will face, and the people who will turn them from challenges into cherished moments that we'll look back in with fondness.</p>
<p class = "text">Happy new year, everyone!  Let's make it a good one!</p>
