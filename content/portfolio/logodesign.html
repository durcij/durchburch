<p class = "text">My passion for logo design began while I was in highschool.  Back in those days, I ran a Pok√©mon-centric news page on Google+ (back when that was a thing).  Back then, I used PowerPoint to create logos that I thought looked cool, granted, looking back, they were often pretty rough, but what highschooler's work isn't still a little rough around the edges?</p>
<p class = "text">I've come a long way since then, and have begun to truly hone those skills into ones that I can now use to create logos for projects that aren't just my own.</p>

    <td class = "tabletext widetext">These two logos are the original DurchBurch logos from 2016.  The black and red color scheme was admittedly edgy for my personality, and the rune-like fontface was, likewise, a bit gritty.  Those issues aside, I'm still quite proud of my execution on the idea to stack "urch" twice and read a modified B in two different ways.  It was an interesting idea, whether or not the design stuck around.</td>

    <td class = "tabletext widetext">This logo symbolized change for my brand.  My significant other at the time expressed concerns that my old branding failed to convey my big, happy personality, offering only a glimse to apparent edge and darkness.  At that time, I was really itching to create a broken or slashed logo design anyway, and thought that rebranding myself to have less edge, breaking that dark face I pushed onto my channel, could work with such symbolism.  This logo is when my branding first adopted the color scheme it now uses, as I wanted to avoid the brooding red and black combination.</td>

  <tr>
    <td class = "tabletext widetext">This logo was came as a result of necessity, but also came as a result of comfort and acceptance with my new branding.  In Fall 2018, my computer's main hard drive crashed, and with it, I lost all of my old branding (what you've seen above was scavenged from around the internet, luckily still at original quality).  I was really happy with my previous branding, but thought that I could still do more to decrease the dark tones from the original design.  I wanted to embrace the personality I strove to give off, and so I drew up an interlocked D and B, creating an embrace between the letters.  I also made the blue color introduced in the slash of the 2018 logo much more important, making a large circle to fill the space behind the letters.  I also knew that I wanted to bring in something to tie it all together, as well as a 4th color, and so I settled on stroking the outside of the logo in white, creating a sticker-like cohesion, something you'll see that I took quite a liking to as you look deeper into this portfolio.</td>

    <td class = "tabletext widetext">Starting in 2018, I began to play board games with several friends as livestreamed content on the DurchBurch channel.  I wanted to have a logo that would be fun and wacky, so I chose a loose and crazy font and vibrant teal and purple colors, one of my favorite retro color combinations.  The choice to add the diamond to the background was made to evoke a sense of looking at a square boardgame on a tabletop, though the decision to add the second at the center was made to simply fill some empty space, though it is notably similar to the slashed DurchBurch logo that would come to be used on the channel not long after this logo was made, showing how early that concept began brewing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td class = "tabletext widetext">With the loss of my old assets on my hard drive, the Interlocked DurchBurch logo wasn't the only new piece of branding to be made.  Board Brains also needed a new logo.  Taking cues from the new DurchBurch logo, I wanted to make it more vibrant, as well.  This resulted in a flipping of which color was more vibrant, and the creation of a shape that was more fun.  While the font used is less loose, the text is meant to evoke a brain, befitting the title of the streams, and the diamond motif was preserved in the background.</td>

Her art heavily features broken glass, which has at many times been used for lettering.  The A and the P from these logos, as well as the heart in the first, are based on actual shards of glass that feature letter-like and heart-like forms, and the P features another aspect of broken glass she looks for, which she calls facing (instances where the broken edge of a piece of glass resembles a facial profile).  The calligraphy featured in the longer logo is based on the calligraphy she often includes in her pieces, and was one of her requests for the logo, as she thought having it present along with the broken glass lettering would better highlight what she wants Art of Pieces to be.</td>
