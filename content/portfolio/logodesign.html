<p class = "text">My passion for logo design began while I was in highschool.  Back in those days, I ran a Pokémon-centric news page on Google+ (back when that was a thing).  Back then, I used PowerPoint to create logos that I thought looked cool, granted, looking back, they were often pretty rough, but what highschooler's work isn't still a little rough around the edges?</p>
<p class = "text">Over the years of running Pokémon News, I honed my skills, working to refine the ideas I had, but where I really began to advance my skills was the start of my YouTube channel DurchBurch.</p>

<center><h2 class = "text">DurchBurch Logos</h2></center>

<center><table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <center><img src = "/officialassets/DurchBurch Stacked Logo 2016.png" alt = "The first official DurchBurch logo.  It makes use of a stacked structure where the top half of the B is initially read as a D, but the full B is read when reading the lower half of the stack." width="50%" class = "tableimage"></center>
      <p class="tabletext">Stacked Logo</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <center><img src = "/officialassets/DB Small Logo 2016.png" alt = "The smaller version of the first official DurchBurch logo.  It's simply the letters DB in the same fontface as the stacked logo." width="50%" class = "tableimage"></center>
      <p class="tabletext">Small Logo</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></center>

<p class = "text">These two logos are the original DurchBurch logos from 2016.  The black and red color scheme was admittedly edgy for my personality, and the rune-like fontface was likewise a bit gritty as well.  Those issues aside, I'm still quite proud of my execution of the idea to stack "urch" twice and read a modified B in two different ways.  It was an interesting idea, whether or not the design stuck around.</p>

      <p class="tabletext">Slashed Logo</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></center>

<p class = "text">This logo symbolized change for my brand.  My significant other at the time expressed concerns that my old branding failed to convey my big and happy personality, offering only a glimse to apparent edge and darkness.  At that time, I was really itching to create a broken or slashed logo design anyway, and thought that rebranding myself to have less edge, breaking that dark face I pushed onto my channel, could work with such symbolism.  This logo is when my branding first adopted the color scheme it now uses, as I wanted to avoid the brooding red and black combination.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <center><img src = "/officialassets/Logo 2019.png" alt = "The third official DurchBurch logo.  It makes use of an interlocked DB with a blue circle behind the letters and a white stroke providing an almost stickerlike appearance." width="50%" class = "tableimage"></center>
      <p class="tabletext">Interlocked Logo</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></center>

<p class = "text">This logo was came as a result of necessity, but also came as a result of comfort and acceptance with my new branding.  In Fall 2018, my computer's main hard drive crashed, and with it, I lost all of my old branding (what you've seen above was scavenged from around the internet, luckily still at original quality).  I was really happy with my previous branding, but thought I could still do more to decrease the dark tones from the original design.  I wanted to embrace the personality I strove to give off, and so I drew up an interlocked D and B, creating an embrace between the letters.  I also made the blue color introduced in the slash of the 2018 logo much more important, making a large circle to fill the space behind the letters.  I also knew that I wanted to bring in something to tie it all together, as well as a 4th color, and so I settled on stroking the outside of the logo in white, creating a sticker-like cohesion.</p>

      <center><img src = "/officialassets/Board Brains Logo 2018.png" alt = "The first official Board Brains logo.  It simply features the words Board Brains on a squashed diamond background with a smaller, even more squashed diamond at the center." width="50%" class = "tableimage"></center>
      <p class="tabletext">Double Diamond Logo</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></center>

<p class = "text">Starting in 2018, I began to play board games with several friends as livestreamed content on the DurchBurch channel.  I wanted to have a logo that would be fun and wacky, so I chose a loose and crazy font and vibrant teal and purple colors, one of my favorite retro color combinations.  The choice to add the diamond to the background was made to evoke a sense of looking at a square boardgame on a tabletop, though the decision to add the second at the center was made to simply fill some empty space, though it is slightly reminiscent of the slashed DurchBurch logo that would come to be used on the channel not long after this logo was made, showing how early that concept began brewing.</p>

      <center><img src = "/officialassets/Board Brains Logo 2019.png" alt = "The second official Board Brains logo.  It features larger text saying Board Brains over a squashed diamond." width="50%" class = "tableimage"></center>
      <p class="tabletext">Brain Logo</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></center>

<p class = "text">With the loss of my old assets on my hard drive, the Interlocked DurchBurch logo wasn't the only new piece of branding to be made.  Board Brains also needed a new logo.  Taking cues from the new DurchBurch logo, I wanted to make it more vibrant, as well.  This resulted in a flipping of which color was more vibrant, and the creation of a shape that was more fun.  While the font used is less loose, the text is meant to evoke a brain, befitting the title of the streams, and the squashed diamond motif was preserved in the background.</p>

<center><h2 class = "text">Miscellaneous Logos</h2></center>
<p class = "text">The following logos are all from projects that weren't heavily tied to my channel's branding as well as logos that are wholly unrelated to my channel.</p>

  <tr>
    <td class = "tabletext">Locus Operandi Logo</td>
  </tr>
</table></center>

<p class = "text">This logo was for the homebrewed tabletop I workshopped with my friends for Board Brains.  The game typically uses D20 dice to track a valuable tool in the game called plot points which can be used by players to define the world of the game.  The reticle was meant to suggest the focus of the game being on the D20, and therefore the plot point.</p>
