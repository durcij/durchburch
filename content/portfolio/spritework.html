<p class = "text">32x32px isn't my typical go-to sprite size, but it is one that I've heavily utilized in Animal Crossing:  New Horizons, as well as in my senior comprehensive project.  The following sprites are standard 32x32 square images.</p>

They feature all of the sprites that comprise every animation for all 8 of the characters.  As all of the sprites were made over a large period of time, I won't individually list the dates of each sheet.  Just know that they were all made in 2019.</p>

I wanted to make something iconic from the game, so I opted for one of the impostor kill screens that would still be easily read at both 64x64px and 1-bit color.</td>
    <td class = "tabletext">This sprite was inspired by one of my favorite scenes in all of the My Hero Academia anime thus far.  I wanted to push myself to the limits Deku pushed himself during the scene.  Well, maybe not that far, I didn't have access to a child who could rewind the consequences.  That aside, I wanted to do something very dynamic with this one, which can be tricky with such a limited resolution and color palette.</td>
    <td class = "tabletext">This sprite was another test of my own abilities.  I wanted to see if I could effectively replicate the realism of a photo of my own eye.  This one was especially tricky, as eyelashes and irises are both very detailed.  In the end, I think I did a pretty effective job, earning this sprite a place in this portfolio.</td>
