<p class = "text">32x32px isn't my typical go-to sprite size, but it is one that I've heavily utilized in Animal Crossing:  New Horizons, as well as in my senior comprehensive project.  The following sprites are standard 32x32 square images.</p>

    <td class = "tabletext">This sprite was made to practice working in 32x32px environments before Animal Crossing:  New Horizons launched, and was made as a general tileset rock sprite that could be inserted into a grid-based, top-down game of some sort.</td>
    <td class = "tabletext">This sprite was made for the members of Allegheny College's Overwatch team, the Bucktails.  I was on the team in 2019-2020 academic year, and, when Animal Crossing:  New Horizons came out, I wanted to give my teammates a poster to hang in their houses somewhere.</td>

<center><h2 class = "text">32x32px Spritesheets</h2></center>
<p class = "text">These sheets, while made up of 32x32px sprites, are full character spritesheets from my senior comprehensive project, Emotion Commotion.  They feature all of the sprites that comprise every animation for all 8 of the characters.  As all of the sprites were made over a large period of time, I won't individually list the dates of each sheet.  Just know that they were all made in 2019.</p>

    <td>
      <p class="tabletext lefttext">The spritesheet for the character Risio from Emotion Commotion.  These are all of his sprites.  As the Aspect of Happiness, he is yellow in color, and his ears are relaxed, but up.  His mechanic is an overall runspeed increase (albeit a slight one).</p>

      <p class="tabletext lefttext">The spritesheet for the character Furia from Emotion Commotion.  These are all of her sprites.  As the Aspect of Rage, she is red in color, and her ears are raised and stiff like horns or mandibles.  Her mechanic is increased projectile speed (and thus attack range).</p>

As the Aspect of Love, he is pink in color, and his ears are firmly raised in the shape of a heart.  His mechanic, were he to have been able to be added to the game, would have been to gain a slow trickle of points whenever he was near other players, though he'd lose them at the same speed while alone.</p>

As the Aspect of Jealousy, she is green in color, and her ears are tightly raised and rolled to show her control and seriousness.  Her mechanic, were she to have been able to be added to the game, would have been to make other players drop more points when she hit them than when they were hit by other characters or NPC's.</p>

As the Aspect of Luck, she is a clovery yellow-green in color, and her ears are rather like Risio's, though there are four of them instead of two.  Her mechanic, were she to have been able to be added to the game, would have been to occasionally dodge the attacks of other characters and NPC's.</p>

<p class = "text">These sprites are all from during Allegheny College Comics Club's Art-tober 2020 event.  This also means that they're all from October 2020.  I limited myself to far below my usual color limits, sitting at a rather tight 2 colors:  true black and true white.</p>

  <tr>
    <td class = "tabletext">This sprite was made while Among Us was still pretty huge back in the late summer and early fall of 2020.  I wanted to make something iconic from the game, so I opted for one of the imposter kill screens that would still be easily read at both 64x64px and 1-bit color.</td>
    <td class = "tabletext">This sprite was inspired by one of my favorite scenes in all of the My Hero Academia anime thus far.  I wanted to push myself to the limits Deku pushed himself during the scene.  Well, maybe not that far, I didn't have access to a child who could rewind the consequences.  That aside, I wanted to do something very dynamic with this one, which can be tricky with such a limited resolution and color palette.</td>
    <td class = "tabletext">This sprite was another test of my own abilities.  I wanted to see if I could effectively replicate the realism of a photo of my own eye.  This one was especially tricky, as eyelashes and irises are both very detailed.  In the end, I think I did a pretty effective job, earning this sprite a place in this portfolio.</td>
