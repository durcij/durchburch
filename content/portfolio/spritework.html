<p class = "text">Spritework is one of my greatest artistic passions.  I've spent years honing my skills, having started my pixel art journey in the Spring of 2017.  In that time, I've worked to gain an understanding of what makes sprites tick, though there is always more to learn.</p>
<p class = "text">If you're considering a commission, I have on-hover titles for each image indicating how much I would have charged for them, were they a paid sprite.  Do note that some values may be approximate, so keep an eye out for "~" signs.  This is because sprites that go beyond typical conventions can have minor price changes.</p>

<center><h2 class = "text">Standard 32x32px</h2></center>
<p class = "text">32x32px isn't my typical go-to sprite size, but it is one that I've heavily utilized in Animal Crossing:  New Horizons, as well as in my senior comprehensive project.  The following sprites are standard 32x32 square images.</p>
