<p class = "text">32x32px isn't my typical go-to sprite size, but it is one that I've heavily utilized in Animal Crossing:  New Horizons, as well as in my senior comprehensive project.  The following sprites are standard 32x32 square images.</p>
<center><table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <center><img src = "/images/portfolio/spritework/Rocks324.png" alt = "A sprite of some scattered rocks designed for use as a tile in a grid-based game."></center>

  <tr>
    <td class = "tabletext">This sprite was made to practice working in 32x32px environments before Animal Crossing:  New Horizons launched, and was made as a general tileset rock sprite that could be inserted into a grid-based, top-down game of some sort.</td>
    <td class = "tabletext">This sprite was made for the members of Allegheny College's Overwatch team, the Bucktails.  I was on the team in 2019-2020 academic year, and, when Animal Crossing:  New Horizons came out, I wanted to give my teammates a poster to hang in their houses somewhere.</td>

<center><h2 class = "text">32x32px Spritesheets</h2></center>
<p class = "text">These sheets, while made up of 32x32px sprites, are full character spritesheets from my senior comprehensive project, Emotion Commotion.  They feature all of the sprites that comprise every animation for all 8 of the characters.  As all of the sprites were made over a large period of time, I won't individually list the dates of each sheet.  Just know that they were all made in 2019.</p>
