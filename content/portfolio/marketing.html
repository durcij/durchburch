<p class = "text">While I didn't work on the base design of the poster, I handled everything below the text about prizes and food.  There was some collaboration, but the vast majority of the calls to action (All but the, "Do you wanna Smash, bro?") were conceptualized and written by me, and all of the artwork and text was placed and formatted by me.</p>

<p class = "text">While at Allegheny, I acted as the treasurer and later vice president of the Legion of Allegheny Gamers, our video game club, as well as the vice president, and eventual president, of Comics Club.  I also played a role in the formation of the Allegheny College eSports, and the Overwatch team the Bucktails, where I played as a support for my final full year on campus.</p>

<p class = "text">Throughout my schooling, I worked on multiple programs built in Unity, including one called <a href="https://github.com/Allegheny-College-Science-310-F2018/project-cmpsc-310-fall-2018-allegheny-college-garfield-5-operation-dessert-lasagna">the Watchers</a>, which was a final project for a class on AI.  It's incomplete as a game, but displys some of my own coding (primarily for character functions like moving), and my proficiency in spritework as of fall 2018.  I also worked on my senior comprehensive project, which also utilized Unity to create a four-player, top-down game called <a href="https://github.com/durcij/game-for-comp">Emotion Commotion</a>.  The game shows how far along my game development, character design, and spriting skills have developed over time.  It's also a project I hope to continue in my free time post-college.</p>

<p class = "text">I've recently begun doing freelance pixel art at a rather reasonable price, though it could probably be argued that I'm undercharging.  That said, examples of my recent spritework can be seen both on my DeviantArt, linked on my <a href="creative.html">Creative</a> page, as well as on my LinkedIn (linked below), under my Freelance Pixel Artist occupation listing.</p>

<p class = "text">For more résumé- or CV-style information, please refer to my LinkedIn as I make an effort to keep it up-to-date.  If you're looking for a true résumé, I apologize, but I don't keep one here, but I'm more than willing to send one your way if you would like one.  My LinkedIn has become my main focus as general professional information goes, so I only write and update my résumés as needed.</p>
